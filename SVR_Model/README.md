- Support vector regression (SVR) is a type of support vector machine (SVM) that is used for regression tasks. It tries to find a function that best predicts the continuous output value for a given input value.

- SVR is a type of support vector machine (SVM), a supervised learning algorithm that can be used for classification or regression tasks. SVMs try to find the hyperplane in a high dimensional space that maximally separates different classes or output values.

- SVR can use different types of kernels, which are functions that determine the similarity between input vectors. 

- we will attempt to fit a Support vector Regression model using an RBF(Radial Basis Function) kernel. This will help us to achieve probably the best results as the RBF kernel is one of the best kernels which helps us to introduce non-linearity in our model.
